## Weather Forecasting for Agricultural Improvement

### Project Description

The "Weather Forecasting for Agricultural Improvement" project aims to utilize advanced technology and data to enhance agriculture and increase farm productivity. This project develops an intelligent forecasting system using weather, climate, and soil data with machine learning and data analysis techniques to provide accurate weather predictions.

### Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Aggregates data from various sources, including weather stations, remote sensors, satellites, and personal weather stations installed on farms.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Employs AI and modern techniques to analyze the collected data and generate accurate weather and climate change predictions.
- **Time Series RNN (LSTMs)**: Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to model and predict time series weather data accurately.

### Objectives

1. **Empowering Farmers**: Providing precise and real-time weather information to farmers, enabling better crop management and strategic decision-making.
2. **Resource Optimization**: Improving the use of natural resources such as water and fertilizers, and reducing the need for chemical pesticides through accurate weather forecasts.
3. **Sustainability**: Contributing to sustainable agriculture by reducing the environmental impact, enhancing productivity and quality, and minimizing costs.

### Data Sources and Modeling

Forecasts for atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, wind speed at 10 meters, relative humidity, and temperature at 2 meters were acquired from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) outputs, with lead times from 1 to 5 days (Pelosi et al., 2020). The COSMO model, part of NOAA's small-scale modeling systems, enables precise and accurate weather and climate predictions.

### Methodology

- **Meteorological Factors**: The model considers atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind to predict future weather conditions.
- **Deep Learning Strategies**: Evaluates various deep learning strategies using data collected from Egyptian weather stations, covering temperature, atmospheric pressure, specific humidity, relative humidity, total precipitation, dew point temperature, and mean wind speed from 2020 to 2024.
- **Physical and Numerical Calculations**: Utilizes complex mathematical equations and grid-based numerical calculations to simulate atmospheric phenomena and generate forecasts.
- **RNN-Based Time Series**: Indexed and adjusted data using the sigmoid activation function, trained the model with a batch generator, and predicted weather parameters using Keras' Sequential model with 50 epochs and 36 steps per epoch, achieving an RMS error of 0.19.

### Benefits

- **Increased Productivity**: Helps farmers make informed decisions based on accurate forecasts, leading to higher crop yields.
- **Cost Reduction**: Optimizes resource management, reducing operational costs.
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Minimizes the environmental footprint of agriculture by promoting the efficient use of resources and reducing the reliance on harmful chemicals.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Enhances farmers' ability to adapt to climate changes and improves resilience against weather variability.
